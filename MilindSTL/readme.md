# MILIND STL 
### Dorky name , Cool Implementation

### Will keep adding useful features.

# ATTENTION : WORK IN PROGRESS 

### WORKING COMPONENTS:

1. StaticStack -  Stack allocated on the stack (pun unintented) , fixed size at compile time O(1) operations , PUSH , POP ,PEEK ,isEmpty
2. StaticArray - Implementation of the std::array class , similiar in functioning , unoptimized
3. ArrayList - Implementation of the std::vector class , similiar , unoptimized
4. SmartTimer - Smart Timer class gives you quick and easy tools to benchmark your code.

### I plan to make this fully compatible with C++ STL with optimizations where possible.


Feel free to use it for inspiration , your projects , help , etc etc. Completely open source.
